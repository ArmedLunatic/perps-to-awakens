This project is a correctness-first accounting exporter for Awaken.



NON-NEGOTIABLE:

\- UI / UX changes ONLY

\- Do NOT modify backend logic, adapters, validation, or CSV export

\- No inferred balances, P\&L, or summaries

\- Blocked > guessed



GOAL:

Redesign the UI to be bright, uplifting, minimal, and futuristic (2030-style),

while remaining serious and audit-safe.



DESIGN DIRECTION:

\- Bright neutral background

\- List-first UI (no table-first layouts)

\- Linear flow: usecase → platform → address → results → export

\- Expandable list rows for events

\- Calm, confident, infrastructure-grade tone

\- Integrity guarantees always visible



If unsure, prefer restraint and clarity.
